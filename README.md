## 🚀 Software Application Overview

**Aegis ICS** is a complete industrial cybersecurity solution engineered to bridge physical edge devices (such as ESP32 microcontrollers, PLCs, and field sensors) with zero-trust security policies and physical safety enforcement rules. 

Unlike traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that passively observe cyberattacks after malicious commands reach physical machinery, **Aegis ICS functions as an active enforcer gateway**. It intercepts telemetry and control commands in real-time, verifying payload HMAC signatures, enforcing cross-parameter physical stress boundaries (preventing Stuxnet-style physical destruction), auditing operator actions with 3D spatial coordinates (`X, Y, Z`), and micro-segmenting compromised devices automatically.

Aegis ICS is distributed as both a standalone desktop application (`AegisICS.exe`) powered by PyWebView and an enterprise Flask web gateway with real-time SCADA interactive dashboards.

---

## 🛡️ The Problem Aegis ICS Solves

1. **Stuxnet-Style Coordinated Physical Stress Attacks**: Cyber-adversaries often send individual commands (e.g., raising temperature or pressure) that appear benign when viewed in isolation, but result in physical destruction when executed concurrently under specific operating states. Aegis ICS evaluates **multi-variable stress vectors** to block dangerous combinations before execution.
2. **Field Device Compromise**: If an edge device or broker credential is hijacked, plain network traffic allows unauthorized command injection. Aegis ICS enforces **HMAC-SHA256 payload signing** on every telemetry packet and command response.
3. **Lack of Spatial & Insider Auditability**: Industrial sabotage often originates from rogue internal operators or compromised credentials. Aegis ICS cryptographically logs operator logins, setpoint changes, and safety violations tagged with the physical 3D location coordinates (`X, Y, Z`) of the control terminal.
4. **Uncontained Blast Radius**: Aegis ICS continuously scores device trust metrics. When anomaly thresholds or HMAC violations occur, the system triggers **automated micro-segmentation**, isolating the rogue device from the control network while maintaining local fail-safe operation.

## ✨ Key Features & Capabilities

- 🔒 **Zero-Trust Telemetry Ingestion**: Every sensor transmission is validated for schema structure, timestamp freshness, and HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signature integrity.
- ⚡ **Stuxnet-Proof Physical Safety Enforcer**: Evaluates mathematical physical limits across temperature, pressure, vibration, current, and RPM variables to reject hazardous operator setpoints.
- 🔌 **Hardware Serial & COM Gateway**: Built-in PySerial communication layer supporting direct USB/Serial connection to ESP32 microcontrollers and industrial PLCs with custom RTS/DTR reset loop prevention.
- 📊 **Real-Time Interactive SCADA Dashboard**: Built with dynamic Chart.js graphing, live telemetry streaming, device quarantine toggles, and safety rule configuration controls.
- 💰 **Financial Risk & Threat Index Engine**: Quantifies potential financial loss, prevented asset damage, telemetry noise index, and sensor drift risk in real time.
- 📄 **Automated PDF & CSV Security Reporting**: Uses ReportLab to dynamically build comprehensive security incident reports complete with operator location metadata and violation logs.
- 🖥️ **Standalone Executable Deployment**: Bundled via PyInstaller into a standalone executable (`AegisICS.exe`) requiring zero pre-installed Python dependencies for deployment.

## 📥 Installation & Quickstart Guide

### Option A: Running Standalone Executable (Windows)

1. Download the latest `AegisICS.exe` executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/anshulec23-cloud/aegis-ics/releases) page.
2. Double-click `AegisICS.exe` to start the standalone desktop application.
3. The desktop application window will open automatically with the embedded SCADA dashboard interface.

### Option B: Running from Source Code (Developer Mode)

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+**
- Git

#### Installation Steps

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anshulec23-cloud/aegis-ics.git
cd aegis-ics

# 2. Set up virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize SQLite Database & Launch Server
python src/app.py
```

After starting `app.py`, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## 🔌 Hardware & Serial Integration

Aegis ICS supports direct physical connection with hardware devices (e.g. ESP32, Arduino, industrial sensors):

1. Connect your ESP32 device via USB/Serial to your system.
2. In the Aegis SCADA Dashboard, navigate to the **Hardware Connection** tab.
3. Click **Scan Ports** to detect available COM ports (e.g., `COM3`, `COM4`).
4. Select your baud rate (default: `115200`) and click **Connect**.
5. The gateway will establish a non-resetting serial stream (disabling DTR/RTS) and ingest signed sensor telemetry live.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Testing

Aegis ICS includes a comprehensive automated test suite covering unit logic, HMAC cryptography, physical safety rules, stress concurrency, fuzzing, and PDF generation.

To run the complete test suite:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/
```

### Test Coverage Highlights
- ✅ **Database & User Authentication**: User creation, hashed credentials, and spatial audit log verification.
- ✅ **Cryptographic HMAC Security**: Key derivation, canonical payload serialization, and signature matching.
- ✅ **Stuxnet Safety Rules**: Single-parameter boundary enforcement and multi-variable coordinated hazard prevention.
- ✅ **Financial & Threat Index**: Asset loss calculation, noise ratio, and sensor drift risk metrics.
- ✅ **Incident Report Generation**: PDF creation and structural validation via ReportLab.
- ✅ **Serial Parser**: Multi-format parsing (JSON, CSV, Key-Value) with error tolerance.
- ✅ **Stress & Concurrency**: Multi-threaded client API requests under heavy load.
- ✅ **Payload Fuzzing**: Malformed inputs, SQL injection attempts, XSS payloads, and boundary conditions.
